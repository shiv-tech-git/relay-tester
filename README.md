Features:
* Lightweight
* Compact
* Powered by 18650 Li-ion battary
* Charging by MicroUSB
 *Friendly menu

There are few events for measuring relay response time:
* Rising voltage edge
* Falling voltage edge
* Contact closure (first edge)
* Contact closure (last edge after bouncing)
* Opening of contacts

Device has 2 voltage inputs (400V max) and 2 sensitile to contacts state inputs. The device able to measure time between two of previously mentioned events.
